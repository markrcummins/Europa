# Europa
Github repository for Team Europa of ICS 414 summer of 2017. The objective of this project was to create an fake ambient object that displayed information through colors. The ambient device takes input and emits the HSB colors 300 to 360 (or from violet to red). Users can choose from two data sources, the first one is the  inflow/outflow of the King river basin located in Fresno, California at this [URL](http://www.spk-wc.usace.army.mil/fcgi-bin/hourly.py?report=pnf&textonly=true). The second source is the exchange range of BitCoin in US dollars at this [URL](http://www.xe.com/currency/xbt-bitcoin?r=).

The project utilizes the java web-scrapping library [Jsoup](https://jsoup.org/download). It also uses JavaFx in JDK 1.8 to utilize lambdas, buttons, and a variety of other tools to create user interfaces and animations for the ambient project.

To run the project in Intellij, clone the [repo](https://github.com/markrcummins/Europa) and create a new Intellij project with it. Then, go to Settings/File -> Project Structure and click on structure and have Java 1.8 as your project SDK. Make sure you also have Jsoup downloaded. Go to Settings/File -> Project Structure again and on global libraries and add Jsoup to your project. Finally, delete the sample folder so that you can run the project's main method. After that, simply build the project and you should be able to run it.
